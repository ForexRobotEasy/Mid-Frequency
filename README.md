# Mid Frequency Forex Software

This is a sample code for the Mid Frequency Forex Software, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This code is provided as an example and can be used to understand how the software works.

## Product Description

The Mid Frequency Forex Software is a trading expert advisor developed for the MetaTrader 5 platform. It uses a mid-frequency trading strategy to identify potential trading opportunities in the market. The software calculates the lot size based on the user-defined risk percentage and stop loss level.

### Features

- Risk percentage per trade can be customized by the user.
- Stop loss and take profit levels can be set by the user.
- Mid-frequency trading strategy for potential trading opportunities.
- Buy and sell trade signals based on analysis.
- Automatic trade placement based on the generated signals.
- Detailed trade signal and lot size information printed in the terminal.

### How It Works

The software initializes by calculating the lot size based on the user-defined risk percentage, account balance, stop loss level, and market information. The calculated lot size is then printed in the terminal along with the risk percentage.

During the tick function, the software retrieves the current market conditions and calculates potential trading opportunities based on the stop loss level and current price. If the ask price is below or equal to the potential buy price, a buy trade signal is generated. If the bid price is above or equal to the potential sell price, a sell trade signal is generated.

The trade signals are printed in the terminal, and the corresponding trades are placed using the calculated lot size. The stop loss and take profit levels are set based on the stop loss and take profit pips defined by the user.

Upon deinitialization, the reason for deinitialization is printed in the terminal.
